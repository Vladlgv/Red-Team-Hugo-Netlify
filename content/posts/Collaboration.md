## Communication
------------
This section is intended to explain the part I played in the R&D Netlab project towards bettering the communication of the team.

## R&D team communication
----------------
Throughout the project I was assigned by my peers as the project leader. As such I was responsible for communication with the Product Owner, the shareholders and the team itself. 

Because I was the project leader and Scrum master I was also tasked with organizing the weekly meetings and conducting the daily stand-ups. A stand-up is a quick meeting where all the members of the team talk about what they are working on and what issues they have. This methodology was adopted by the team fast and it allowed us to work independently on separate parts of the project while still knowing what the overall situation of the project was.

In addition to this the stand-up where small evaluations of our trello tasks where we could determine together how much each task would take and if we need help to complete them. Moreover, as the scrum leader I was responsible for keeping track and managing the trello boards of the project.

## R&D shareholder communication
---------------------
A second responsibility that I took upon myself was to organize the meetings with the shareholders. In the first 2 sprints I was the one that sent the emails and made sure that the agenda was sent to all the members. For the last 2 sprint meetings the PO decided that he wants to be in charge of creating the meetings, but the team was still responsible with creating and distributing the agenda.

On top of that, to ensure that the meetings would be as efficient as possible I was the one that orchestrated the communication during the sprint meetings and would make sure that the agenda was distributed and followed throughout the meeting.

Another part that I played was mediation between the team and the shareholders. It was my job to deliver any requests that we might need to the shareholders. This meaning emails, team communicaitons, detailed requests (for information, permissions or additional resources), calendar meetings, udpdates within the team (members that left, problems) and conducting the weekly PO meetings.
## Colleague Feedback
Throughout the project we used the Canvas evaluation system to determine the overall opinion of the colleagues of each other.

As it can be seen throughout the project my teammates have given me positive feedback and were satisfied with the work that I have done throughout the project.

## Shareholder Feedback

To keep track of the feedback that the shareholders gave us, I came up with a system that I used in other projects. This method was the use of minutes, notes taken during a meeting on all the agenda topics and the questions/requests remarks of the shareholders upon which all agree at the end of the meeting. 

Throughout the project I have made sure that we reviewed the minutes at the end of all meetings and that the feedback/requests are clear for both sides.
