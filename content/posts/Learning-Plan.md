## 1.	Who I am:
****

I am Vlad, I am a fourth year student, I started Fontys with the goal of becoming a programmer, as I kept studying and learning about new paths I discovered that I am more interested in networking and the backend part of the development process. That is why I looked for a specialization that delves in this. I chose Cybersecurity because it involved learning about networking, infrastructure and the way things work. I enjoy learning about the way system work and knowing little tricks and hacks to exploit this system. I had a great deal of fun (and a equal amount of frustration) learning about the different attack methods and how hackers think and make their attacks. 
Until now I have completed my first 3 years of studies, I have followed the software engineering track where I have learned about web development, application development, programming principles, design patterns and  many different programming languages such as c#, python, java, php, GoLang , C, C++. All this was done through practical projects, at this point I have completed all 3 major projects PROCP, PROP and PROEP all of them requiring us to make a project together with a group teaching us about software development with a group. 

In addition to my software development track   I have chosen cybersecurity as my main specialization. I have completed both the offensive and defensive specializations where I have learned many things that I hope to build upon in this minor, such as writing a proper report how to structure a Pentest, different attack techniques such as XSS , buffer overflow,  phishing, SQL injection, cross site scripting etc. But also, how to defend a system and how it is build therefore learning how to better use virtual environments, networking topologies, using DMZs, network sniffers and IDS like snort and different kinds of tools. 

On top of all that, I also had an internship with a cybersecurity-based assignment, here I starting learning more about the security engineering. I learned how DevOps is used for automation and securing of the development process. How tests are automated, how cloud, containers and monitoring are tied together and how security software is made. 
Based on all the things I have learned throughout the years I have concluded that the things that I enjoy the most are programming, learning about new systems and exploiting them. At this point I am at a impasse as to what my ideal job would be I like being a DevOps engineer but I also wish to become security analyst. 

Regardless, my ideal job would be a combination of a pen tester and a DevOps engineer (which I don’t know if it exists yet) but at my current level I know that I  want to pursue a OSPC certification which would help me either way to become a better security professional. Therefore, my plan for my future semester is to learn and take the OSCP exam.


 
## 2.Learning plan: 

__What is OSCP__

PWK stands for “Penetration Testing With Kali Linux”, it is the name of the course you take in order to become an OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional).

The course itself is usually refereed to as OSCP but that is in fact the name of the certification you achieve.

**The skills:**

For this semester I want to work a lot more on applying and learning how to hack machines, how to better apply the offensive techniques that we learned in the first year and how to gain confidence in my penetration skills. I believe this will truly help me become more confident in my cybersecurity knowledge.
For this I plan on taking and following the OSCP certification course and exam. Because of this I will try my best to follow their curriculum which involves the following skills: 	
### 2.1. OSCP Skills

1.	Managing Kali Linux Services
2.	Bash scripting
3.	Using network reconnaissance tools like netcat, socat etc.
4.	Passing information gathering sources
5.	Active reconnaissance, port scanning, enumeration, and vulnerability scanning.
6.	Web applications attacks
7.	Windows Buffer Overflow
8.	Linux Buffer Overflow
9.	Client-side Attacks
10.	Running and fixing exploits
11.	File transfer
12.	Antivirus evasion
13.	Privilege escalation
14.	Windows privilege escalation
15.	Linux privilege escalation
16.	Password attacks 
17.	Port redirection and tunneling
18.	Active directory attacks.
19.	Active directory lateral movement
20.	Metaesploit
21.	Powershell modules
22.	Database targeting
23.	Additional Hack the box resources.
 

For the Red team track we need to fulfill the following learning goals:

### 2.2. Red Team Track Skills
1.	Own one of the active Linux based machines in Hack the Box and create a write-up of it, see
2.	Own one of the active Windows based machines in Hack the Box and create a write-up of it, see 
3.	Set up and perform a pen-test on an (early version of a potentially shippable) product of one of the cyber security R&D project
4.	Perform a vulnerability analysis on a (smartphone) app. Report your findings through responsible disclosure.
5.	Perform vulnerability analysis on a device (hardware/consumer products). Report your findings through responsible disclosure.
6.	 Look into the security of IoT or OT (e.g. PLC) protocols and technology and find and replay one or more hacks or other security incidents in a test environment. (S)
7.	 Prepare towards a Red Team - Blue Team exercise (day/event) with the Security Engineering students and the Blue Team students to attack and test the IT systems and applications developed by the Security Engineering students and the Blue teaming Capabilities of the Blue Teaming students. Test your red teaming skills, procedures and red team toolbox and environment. Use the experience of the first event to improve your Red Teaming systems, toolbox, skills, and procedures.
8.	Work on challenge(s) of your personal interest, some ideas are presented during the red-teaming kickoff
9.	 Set up your personal toolbox environments for pen-testing and red teaming.
10.	Read about covert channels (see e.g. [8][9]), find applications of covert channels in hacking and red teaming, and set-up one or several experimental applications of covert channels
11.	Learn how to do reversing of smartphone apps (for android, iphone, ...).
12.	Experiment with phishing tooling in a controlled, separated environment
13.	Find a couple of red teaming and pen-tester vacancies with job descriptions and analyse what task and skills are described. Add to and update your learning plan as needed.

### Weekly adevancement

### Week 1

__Goal - Find out agenda__

For the first week the goal was to determine what was needed of us to accomplish for this minor and later it turned into defining the learning goals and activities that I wish to accomplish. Because this year we were required to make our portfolio with a website I had difficulties deciding on the correct framework to build the website with.

__Achieved__ 
At this point in time I was able to define my learning plan and clarified the goals of the project

__To improve__  
I wanted to already start on building the website for my portfolio. I achieved this by making a Heroku website that was React Based

### Week 2

__Goal -Hack a linux machine on Hack the Box –__

For this week my goal was to Hack a box on the suggested working environment of Hack the Box. The box that I chose was SwagShop it was rated as easy but I took it as a personal challenge to not use the write up or any of the documentation and instead try and hack it by myself without any help. This proved to take longer than I anticipated. I learned how to use several tools better because of this fact. I used Nmap and wrote several scripts to use. I used Nikto which helped me find vulnerabilities in the webpage, service port 80. I spent a lot of time trying to find more ways into the machine and lost too much time trying to inspect the website format. In the end I remembered I could use searchsploit for some of the things I discovered like the website builder framework and eventually found an exploit that looked promising. But this happened after looking at 5 others and not knowing which one to use. At this point I was able to get inside the admin page on the website where I used another exploit to get a reverse shell. This was hard because I did not know how to make a reverse shell. For the root administrator I needed help as I did not know how to escalate privileges and Google searches did not help with this matter.

__Achieved__ 

It took me the whole week to work on the machine and I believe I had some moments when I was stuck and I could have used the help of someone else or I could have consulted the write-ups without feeling I was cheating because my goal is to learn as much as possible not necessarily hack the box.

__To improve__ 

During the whole process I managed to create a note making system but I should make a habit out of making a write up for the machines that I have hacked. This will help me both to get used to making write ups and to create content for the portfolio.
 
### Week 3

__Goal - Hack the Box start another machine –__

For this week I started another box but I could not progress too far with it and realized I had connectivity issues with the Hack the Box labs. I could not connect with the VPN and I had to reinstall kali losing the notes I took on the other machine in the process. As a result, I ended up not achieving much over learning how to set up kali correctly and put a new password. I used the extra time to learn more about the OSCP exam and researched different blogs and podcasts about the process, the necessary skills and the OSCP test.

__Achieved__ 

I did not hack another box or other boxes this week but I managed to research the journey of other OSCP graduates and learned about the most important subjects in the OSCP curriculum and the one suggested by everyone to focus on was Buffer Overflow. I will continue to work on this subject.

__To improve__ 

Work more on Hack the box

### Week 4

__Goal – Create the portfolio website and report on the current status of the learning process-__

For this week the goal was to create the portfolio website. I first started by crating a React website but that proved to be more difficult than anticipated since I only knew the basics of React. I spent the rest of the week trying to learn React and concluded it will take too long to build a website from scratch for the project. I started researching other website platforms for the portfolio and I managed to find something that I could start working on that was only css, javascript and html based.

__Achieved__

Found a website model on git that I can start improving on 

__To improve__

Because I got stuck on making the website I could not write a writeup for the website and I could not update the portfolio. I should make the writeups after I finish hacking a box or machine.
 
### Week 5 

__Goal -Read documentation for the OSCP-__

Personally, I structured my minor around the OSCP specialization. I wanted to start sooner with it but I only decided on it in the 4th week and after buying the exam it takes one week to receive the material and access to the lab. For the first week I focused on reading the materials that were supplied by them. It is a book of 800 pages and I managed to read the first 323 pages due to the technical nature of the material. It is filled with useful information but seems like I should work more on the lab.

__Achieved__

Read 323 pages through the book material of the course.

__To improve__

Start working on the video material and also finish the book documentation.

### Week 6

__Goal - Hack the box catch up + Website start –__
 

Due to finding a better platform I chose to make the website using the Hugo platform. All websites are templated and to write blogs/ posts/ entries you can use markdown. This seemed like the most useful tool and I managed to create a website that contained the learning plan for now but I will start adding the writeups for the machines that I have hacked. Additionally, I have worked on 2 other Hack the box machines and completed them. I did this as trying the OSCP lab proved to be a harder task for now than anticipated and I will wait until I finish the reading material and go through more OSCP like Hack the box machines. All machines are documented using Cherry tree and I need to find a easy way to convert the notes from Cherry tree into writeups written in Markdown.


__Achieved__

I finally chose a platform for my portfolio, Hugo. I converted the learning plan inside it. I Worked on 2 more Hack the Box machines and I attempted to work on the OSCP lab with no results for the moment.

__To improve__

Attempt more machines in the OSCP lab, finish reading the Documentaiton, start watching the video material for OSCP, Create WriteUps for the current Machines
### Week 7

### Week 8
__Goal - Red Team vs Blue Team –__
 

The goal of this week is to prepare and to attend the Red team vs Blue team event. During this event the red team had to attempt to hack in to the websites created by the security engineers. This proved to be a challenge as most of the applications, at least the ones that we tested were not finished or not even running, therefore there was little we could exploit. Regardless the experience was quite interesting and insightful teaching us to organize ourself as a Red Team, work as a team with other classmates and share knowledge about hte way we approach a hack. 


__Achieved__

After stuggling for the first part of the day to connect to Seclab as my credentials did not work. For the second part of the day I have scanned and found some vulnerabilites on one of the machines but sadly was not able to exploit it as we did not have the necessary time to attack it. As a result most of the day was spent enumerating, searching for exploits and trying different SQL injections and automated scripts based on the little that we found.

__To improve__

For the next R vs B event I will make sure that my Seclab credentials are working and that I know ahead of time what machines are going to be tested by my team as to be able to prepare and talk with the developers of the machines so they are up and running during the event. In addition I should polish my penetration skills.

### Classification of priorities 
Based on my own goals the OSCP curriculum will have the highest priority as I plan to take the test. After some personal research I have found that Buffer Overflow is one of the most important skills to acquire therefore it is the most important on the list, Also the reason I have scheduled it for 2 weeks. 
In addition to that, hacking one or more boxes in HackTheBox before I start the OSCP lab time is ideal for me to be able to use the lab at its best. Therefore, getting familiar with the KALI tools that I will be using is second of the list of priorities but first in the timeline.
As a result a initial prioritization classification of the activities would be:
1.	Buffer Overflow
2.	Other OSCP related curriculum 
3.	Kali tooling mastery
4.	Others
 
## 2.5. Overall Plan Explanation
***

For this semester I plan on following the OSCP certification path, but due to the limitation of 90 days of lab (maximum time you can have for the OSCP lab) the first weeks will be used in HackTheBox, a website that offers vulnerable machines and try to get into the ones that are similar to OSCP machines. A list of them can be found online, and this will serve as good practice with the software needed there. On top of that in the first weeks I want to make the structure of the website for the report so that I only must add onto it as time flies by. 
For reporting the process, I have been inspired by the workshop of HackTheBox and I want to keep Cherry (text editor) notes on the hacking process of every machine and then migrate those into the website. For the website I was hoping to make a one pager that contains all the information with a few additional pages for References, Videos or any other materials that might be helpful for understanding the nature of the research. But the ideas for the website might change in accordance with the nature of the content.
After the beginning weeks I plan to follow the OSCP curriculum that I have included in this document. It does go through most of the requirements of this course as shown in the previous Parallels table. Furthermore, the curriculum is well structured and it is possible that I might actually be focusing on different parts of it in different weeks (but overall, those will be the learning goals). 
Something that I did not include in the planning were the vacation weeks. I will be working on the OSCP curriculum in those as well and most likely I will be taking the OSCP exam during the Christmas vacation. That is why after the 15th week I will start working on other unrelated subjects like something that interests me lockpicking, social analysis and if time permits android reversing.
The plan stated above might have slight deviation as time goes as I am not sure how the OSCP course and materials are divided and as such I will have to follow the order that is set in their learning materials. However, I believe that the learning points will be the same, I will cover the suggested curriculum and I should be prepared for any Red Teaming Graduation project.
