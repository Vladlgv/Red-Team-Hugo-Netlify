Throughout the project, the team and I have maintained a methodical approach towards our product delivery and our work division.

In the first weeks, the team received the assignment from the network administrators of Fontys. Because our assignment was a multiple choice assignment we had to determine ourselves what we could do and how to achieve it in the time frame given to us.

To that end, the team used a structured approach to determine the needs of the clients and the limitations of the project. This can be seen in the analysis documents made in the first phase:

Based on our analysis and the meeting that we had with the stakeholders as often as called for we were able to start decomposing the requirements into deliverables and afterward into a plan.




#### Project plan
In order to create our deliverables, we made use of the DOT framework research approach. This can be seen in the documents that we created to break down our main task or as we needed to define our main question into smaller questions that later on activities on which we based our plan of action. This breakdown can be seen in this document[Project Research Approach](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/5785C6E4-4853-40B2-8067-C8A730888F5B?tenantId=c66b6765-b794-4a2b-84ed-845b341c086a&fileType=docx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fstichtingfontys.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FCyberSecurityMinor20192020-FHICTresearchanddevelopmentproject%2FGedeelde%20documenten%2FFHICT%20research%20and%20development%20project%2FProjectResearchApproach.docx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fstichtingfontys.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FCyberSecurityMinor20192020-FHICTresearchanddevelopmentproject&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:5d69e2a976384993af588f7e4a8c8ca3@thread.skype&groupId=03769ec5-ba87-41ba-add8-d725dfd80e35)

Based on the breakdown of the activities and the summation of all the research we have done until now which can be found in the [phase product](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/84CF0C80-57C2-434A-89AF-58386356F8BF?tenantId=c66b6765-b794-4a2b-84ed-845b341c086a&fileType=docx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fstichtingfontys.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FCyberSecurityMinor20192020-FHICTresearchanddevelopmentproject%2FGedeelde%20documenten%2FFHICT%20research%20and%20development%20project%2FPhase%20Product.docx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fstichtingfontys.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FCyberSecurityMinor20192020-FHICTresearchanddevelopmentproject&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:5d69e2a976384993af588f7e4a8c8ca3@thread.skype&groupId=03769ec5-ba87-41ba-add8-d725dfd80e35). The team was able to create a dedicated Project plan that oversaw the activities listed and broke them down in time based goals for the project.

#### Agile approach
After the stakeholders agreed to the project plan the team decided that we need to use an Agile approach to the project so we are more flexible to the requests of the stakeholders regarding the deliverables.

With this in mind, we kept ourselves organized through the use of  [Trello](https://trello.com/b/mvYVxkuR/fhict-rd).

##### [Figure 1.0 - Trello sprints ]
At the beginning of each sprint, we divided the defined the main goals of the sprint. In this way, we were able to create sub-activities that were aimed at fulfilling those goals.

The sprint goals were decided at the beginning of each sprint and were based on the goals set by the team in the project plan and the feedback that was given to the team by the stakeholders.

In order to ensure accountability on both sides, the team kept notes on all the meetings had with the stakeholders for the sprint reviews.

![image alt text](/Trello/TasksToBeMade.png)
##### [Figure 2.0 - Trello Activities ]
To better organize ourselves as a team we had 2 weekly meetings where we did stand-ups. In the stand-up sessions each member could talk about the activities they finished, the problems they are facing, and what they think they should work on next to achieve the goals.


![image alt text](/Trello/Labeling.png)
##### [Figure 3.0 - Trello labeling ]
In order to better track the tasks, we made use of the labeling systems that came with Trello, here we added the due date of the activity, the members that are responsible for it, and some general information about the nature of the task so as to know what kind of work it was.


![image alt text](/Trello/Finished.png)
##### [Figure 4.0 - Trello finishing tasks ]
Once an activity was finished it was moved in the finished pile, we kept this board in order to justify our workloads and to justify our individual and group contributions to the project. This way everybody could know what they worked on and what they should be focusing on working next.


On top of working with the Trello boards, the state of the deliverables was reported to the stakeholders during the sprint meetings in a presentation. To keep track of the current state the team also made sure to create a proof of the sprint deliverables in [sprint reviews](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/school/files/FHICT%20research%20and%20development%20project?threadId=19%3A5d69e2a976384993af588f7e4a8c8ca3%40thread.skype&ctx=channel&context=Minutes&rootfolder=%252Fsites%252FCyberSecurityMinor20192020-FHICTresearchanddevelopmentproject%252FGedeelde%2520documenten%252FFHICT%2520research%2520and%2520development%2520project%252FMinutes). 


#### Personal contributions 

As the project leader and scrum master, I was the one responsible for the team's coordination. Therefore I was the one that chose and maintained the Trello boards, the one responsible for submitting the documents to the stakeholders and evaluation faculties and for ensuring the documents are satisfactory. On top of that, I opened the stand-up meetings and the sprint reviews and was the one that had to answer the questions of the stakeholders and to communicate the needs of the team to them.
