## 1.	Who I am:
****

I am Vlad, I am a fourth year student, I started Fontys with the goal of becoming a programmer, as I kept studying and learning about new paths I discovered that I am more interested in networking and the backend part of the development process. That is why I looked for a specialization that delves in this. I chose Cybersecurity because it involved learning about networking, infrastructure and the way things work. I enjoy learning about the way system work and knowing little tricks and hacks to exploit this system. I had a great deal of fun (and a equal amount of frustration) learning about the different attack methods and how hackers think and make their attacks. 
Until now I have completed my first 3 years of studies, I have followed the software engineering track where I have learned about web development, application development, programming principles, design patterns and  many different programming languages such as c#, python, java, php, GoLang , C, C++. All this was done through practical projects, at this point I have completed all 3 major projects PROCP, PROP and PROEP all of them requiring us to make a project together with a group teaching us about software development with a group. 

In addition to my software development track   I have chosen cybersecurity as my main specialization. I have completed both the offensive and defensive specializations where I have learned many things that I hope to build upon in this minor, such as writing a proper report how to structure a Pentest, different attack techniques such as XSS , buffer overflow,  phishing, SQL injection, cross site scripting etc. But also, how to defend a system and how it is build therefore learning how to better use virtual environments, networking topologies, using DMZs, network sniffers and IDS like snort and different kinds of tools. 

On top of all that, I also had an internship with a cybersecurity-based assignment, here I starting learning more about the security engineering. I learned how DevOps is used for automation and securing of the development process. How tests are automated, how cloud, containers and monitoring are tied together and how security software is made. 
Based on all the things I have learned throughout the years I have concluded that the things that I enjoy the most are programming, learning about new systems and exploiting them. At this point I am at a impasse as to what my ideal job would be I like being a DevOps engineer but I also wish to become security analyst. 

Regardless, my ideal job would be a combination of a pen tester and a DevOps engineer (which I don’t know if it exists yet) but at my current level I know that I  want to pursue a OSPC certification which would help me either way to become a better security professional. Therefore, my plan for my future semester is to learn and take the OSCP exam.


 
## 2.Learning plan: 

__What is OSCP__

PWK stands for “Penetration Testing With Kali Linux”, it is the name of the course you take in order to become an OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional).

The course itself is usually refereed to as OSCP but that is in fact the name of the certification you achieve.

**The skills:**

For this semester I want to work a lot more on applying and learning how to hack machines, how to better apply the offensive techniques that we learned in the first year and how to gain confidence in my penetration skills. I believe this will truly help me become more confident in my cybersecurity knowledge.
For this I plan on taking and following the OSCP certification course and exam. Because of this I will try my best to follow their curriculum which involves the following skills: 	
### 2.1. OSCP Skills

1.	Managing Kali Linux Services
2.	Bash scripting
3.	Using network reconnaissance tools like netcat, socat etc.
4.	Passing information gathering sources
5.	Active reconnaissance, port scanning, enumeration, and vulnerability scanning.
6.	Web applications attacks
7.	Windows Buffer Overflow
8.	Linux Buffer Overflow
9.	Client-side Attacks
10.	Running and fixing exploits
11.	File transfer
12.	Antivirus evasion
13.	Privilege escalation
14.	Windows privilege escalation
15.	Linux privilege escalation
16.	Password attacks 
17.	Port redirection and tunneling
18.	Active directory attacks.
19.	Active directory lateral movement
20.	Metaesploit
21.	Powershell modules
22.	Database targeting
23.	Additional Hack the box resources.
 

For the Red team track we need to fulfill the following learning goals:

### 2.2. Red Team Track Skills
1.	Own one of the active Linux based machines in Hack the Box and create a write-up of it, see
2.	Own one of the active Windows based machines in Hack the Box and create a write-up of it, see 
3.	Set up and perform a pen-test on an (early version of a potentially shippable) product of one of the cyber security R&D project
4.	Perform a vulnerability analysis on a (smartphone) app. Report your findings through responsible disclosure.
5.	Perform vulnerability analysis on a device (hardware/consumer products). Report your findings through responsible disclosure.
6.	 Look into the security of IoT or OT (e.g. PLC) protocols and technology and find and replay one or more hacks or other security incidents in a test environment. (S)
7.	 Prepare towards a Red Team - Blue Team exercise (day/event) with the Security Engineering students and the Blue Team students to attack and test the IT systems and applications developed by the Security Engineering students and the Blue teaming Capabilities of the Blue Teaming students. Test your red teaming skills, procedures and red team toolbox and environment. Use the experience of the first event to improve your Red Teaming systems, toolbox, skills, and procedures.
8.	Work on challenge(s) of your personal interest, some ideas are presented during the red-teaming kickoff
9.	 Set up your personal toolbox environments for pen-testing and red teaming.
10.	Read about covert channels (see e.g. [8][9]), find applications of covert channels in hacking and red teaming, and set-up one or several experimental applications of covert channels
11.	Learn how to do reversing of smartphone apps (for android, iphone, ...).
12.	Experiment with phishing tooling in a controlled, separated environment
13.	Find a couple of red teaming and pen-tester vacancies with job descriptions and analyse what task and skills are described. Add to and update your learning plan as needed.

### Classification of priorities 
Based on my own goals the OSCP curriculum will have the highest priority as I plan to take the test. After some personal research I have found that Buffer Overflow is one of the most important skills to acquire therefore it is the most important on the list, Also the reason I have scheduled it for 2 weeks. 
In addition to that, hacking one or more boxes in HackTheBox before I start the OSCP lab time is ideal for me to be able to use the lab at its best. Therefore, getting familiar with the KALI tools that I will be using is second of the list of priorities but first in the timeline.
As a result a initial prioritization classification of the activities would be:
1.	Buffer Overflow
2.	Other OSCP related curriculum 
3.	Kali tooling mastery
4.	Others
 
## 2.5. Overall Plan Explanation
***

For this semester I plan on following the OSCP certification path, but due to the limitation of 90 days of lab (maximum time you can have for the OSCP lab) the first weeks will be used in HackTheBox, a website that offers vulnerable machines and try to get into the ones that are similar to OSCP machines. A list of them can be found online, and this will serve as good practice with the software needed there. On top of that in the first weeks I want to make the structure of the website for the report so that I only must add onto it as time flies by. 
For reporting the process, I have been inspired by the workshop of HackTheBox and I want to keep Cherry (text editor) notes on the hacking process of every machine and then migrate those into the website. For the website I was hoping to make a one pager that contains all the information with a few additional pages for References, Videos or any other materials that might be helpful for understanding the nature of the research. But the ideas for the website might change in accordance with the nature of the content.
After the beginning weeks I plan to follow the OSCP curriculum that I have included in this document. It does go through most of the requirements of this course as shown in the previous Parallels table. Furthermore, the curriculum is well structured and it is possible that I might actually be focusing on different parts of it in different weeks (but overall, those will be the learning goals). 
Something that I did not include in the planning were the vacation weeks. I will be working on the OSCP curriculum in those as well and most likely I will be taking the OSCP exam during the Christmas vacation. That is why after the 15th week I will start working on other unrelated subjects like something that interests me lockpicking, social analysis and if time permits android reversing.
The plan stated above might have slight deviation as time goes as I am not sure how the OSCP course and materials are divided and as such I will have to follow the order that is set in their learning materials. However, I believe that the learning points will be the same, I will cover the suggested curriculum and I should be prepared for any Red Teaming Graduation project.
